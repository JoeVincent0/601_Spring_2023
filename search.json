It appears that the data set is showing the number of railroad employees by county in the United States.\nThe least number of railroad employees in a given county is 1, and the greatest number of railroad employees in a given county is over 8,000.\nThere is a mean number of employees per county of about 87, but with a large standard deviation (283).\nI learned that there are 31 counties with the name “Washington” and 26 counties with the name “Jefferson”."
